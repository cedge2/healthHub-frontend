 Title: HealthHub
 
 An example site that can be used to help administrators organize patient info and doctor appointments
 
Features: BMI Calculator - Patient List - Admin List - Doctors List - Calender 
features to implement: Site is a work in progress, still would like to impliment sorting, updating information, and possibly some sort of symptom-checker.  As of now since the site is mostly just for demo/ practice purposes, I have it set so that anyone can reach any page.  However, if were to modify for real production, I would make it so that patients, doctors, and admin all sign in to a different page / can access only certain parts.  For example, a patient could log in to calculate BMI and see upcoming appointments, but would not be able to add or remove doctors like an admin would.  
Would add functionality to uploading user profile pictures.

User flow: An admin would log in, and can add a new patient / doctor.  Can also set an appointment fromt he calendar page.
